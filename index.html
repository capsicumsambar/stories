            <p>The sun was shining brightly over the bustling city of Mumbai. Ten-year-old Anika and her friends, Rohan and Jia, were playing in the park near their apartment building. They were having a blast, chasing each other around the banyan tree and making up silly games. Anika had brought her pet hamster, Chintu, along in his little cage, and he was happily munching on sunflower seeds, enjoying the fresh air and sunshine. Nearby, a group of pigeons cooed and strutted, hoping for a few crumbs to fall their way.</p>

            <p>Suddenly, a loud crash echoed through the park. Anika, Rohan, and Jia froze mid-game, their eyes wide with surprise. They turned to find Chintu's cage lying on its side, the door wide open, and the little hamster nowhere to be seen! Anika's heart pounded in her chest. Where could Chintu have gone? Had he been hurt? What if a cat had snatched him away?</p>

            <p>Rohan noticed a small, muddy puddle near the overturned cage. "Look!" he exclaimed, pointing to a tiny paw print in the mud. "It's too small for a cat, but too big for Chintu." Jia noticed some scattered sunflower seeds near the puddle, but the trail disappeared into the thick grass. "Chintu must have escaped," she said, "But what made that paw print, and how did the cage fall over?" Anika felt a wave of panic. They had to find Chintu before it was too late! But what had happened? Yaar panna?</p>
